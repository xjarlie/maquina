# MAQUINA

My attempt at making a 2-dimensional game engine running in HTML canvas. 

By the end, Maquina should have:
- Image and geometric sprites, with support for animations and importing spritesheets
- Interactable GUI (built entirely within canvas, without using additional HTML)
- A physics & collision system (current plan is to add MatterJS for now, until I can build my own)
